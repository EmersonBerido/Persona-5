            [Verse 1]<br>
            Where have you been? Been searching all along<br>
            Came facing twilight, on and on, without a clue<br>
            Without a sign - without grasping, yet<br>
            The real question to be asked: where have I been?<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            I'm a shapeshifter at Poe's masquerade<br>
            Hiding both face and mind, all free for you to draw<br>
            I'm a shapeshifter - what else should I be?<br>
            Please don't take off my mask, revealing dark<br>
            <br>
            [Verse 2]<br>
            Moments of calm, nothing left to be found<br>
            A mirror right in front of me, that's where I find<br>
            An empty glass, reflecting the sad truth<br>
            It's telling words not to be told: I need the mask<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            I'm a shapeshifter at Poe's masquerade<br>
            Hiding both face and mind, all free for you to draw<br>
            I'm a shapeshifter, chained down to my core<br>
            Please don't take off my mask, my place to hide<br>
            <br>
            [Bridge]<br>
            I can't tell you how to see me<br>
            Just a cage of bones, there's nothing inside<br>
            Will it unleash me, burning down the walls?<br>
            Is there a way for me to break?<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            I'm a shapeshifter at Poe's masquerade<br>
            Hiding both face and mind, all free for you to draw<br>
            I'm a shapeshifter; have no face to show<br>
            Please don't take off my mask, my disguise

            [Verse 1]<br>
            It's not a game<br>
            I'm not a robot AI challenging you<br>
            I'm not a phantom<br>
            I'm in your face and I'm here to see it through<br>
            Right before your eyes, watch us multiply<br>
            Come to claim our rights, it's time<br>
            As our power grows, tryin' to stop us shows<br>
            (You) Might as well go try'n stop time<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            So you know that we're out there<br>
            Swatting lies in the making<br>
            Can't move fast without breaking<br>
            Can't hold on or life won't change<br>
            And our voices ring out, yeah<br>
            Took the mask off to feel free<br>
            Fought it out in the debris<br>
            Now, we know that life will change<br>
            <br>
            [Verse 2]<br>
            Ain't it a shame<br>
            I'm not a figment of your ailing old mind<br>
            I'm just as real and<br>
            I'm just as dangerous as you, so know you'll find<br>
            A taste of your own meds, fire in every breath<br>
            Fight inside your head, your heart<br>
            And as your crippled brain tries to fight in vain<br>
            Your empire will fall apart<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            And you'll know we were out there<br>
            Swatted lies in the making<br>
            Your empire for the taking<br>
            Can't hold on or life won't change<br>
            And our voices rang out, yeah<br>
            Took the mask off to feel free<br>
            Fought it out in the debris<br>
            Now, we know that life will change<br>
