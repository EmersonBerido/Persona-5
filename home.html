      <p> 
        Persona 5 is an urban fantasy game based on reality which follows a group of troubled high school students: the protagonist and a collection of compatriots he meets along the way. All having lost their place to belong in a broken world, these troubled teenagers gradually realize that they are living in a toxic and dangerous society resembling a prison full of slavery, oppression and injustice, ruled by corrupted and twisted adults. They can't live with the system and can't live without it, and simply existing means they are at risk of being doomed and condemned to a life of slavery

        An enhanced version, titled <b>Persona 5 Royal</b>, was released on PlayStation 4 on October 31st, 2019 in Japan and worldwide on March 31, 2020. Royal later launched for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam & the Microsoft Store, worldwide on October 21, 2022. It includes many new features, including new characters, battle mechanics and a third semester added to the story. This might not necessarily entirely replace the original game (particularly for PlayStation 3 players), however, Persona enthusiasts may still enjoy this game's slightly higher difficulty, as well as prefer the original enemy and boss behaviors.

        The story examines the concept and problem of individuality and pursuing one's own personal beliefs to help a collective society in a reality that is unjust and oppressive. The Phantom Thieves of Hearts find the courage to stand up for their own beliefs to help others even if the world they're trying to save directly opposes them. Because of that conflict, they preserve the will to care about the world instead of shutting themselves away from it, whether it is to shut themselves and its desires away from themselves, or even directly exploit it for their own personal gain. Exploring Jungian psychology via concepts such as the "collective unconscious," individuality in one's own beliefs is tactfully separated via the message that there's "no real world" and that the "real world exists within you" given by Morgana at the end of the story.
